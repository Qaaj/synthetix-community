To bootstrap the network early on, the Synthetix team implemented a high incentive inflation model from March 2019, designed to attract capital and promote staking. More on Synthetix's monetary policy and the decision-making process <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-monetary-policy-changes/">here</a>. 

This inflationary monetary policy was planned to begin as a 75% annualized rate distributed weekly, and was set to halve each year for five years. However, <a href="https://blog.synthetix.io/the-capella-release/" target="_blank" class="link">a community-driven initiative</a> that reached consensus through community governance smoothed the inflation rate in December 2019. You can read a detailed post about this process <a href="https://blog.synthetix.io/reaching-monetary-policy-consensus/" target="_blank" class="link">here</a>.

This update also added a perpetual 2.5% annual inflation beginning on September 7, 2023, the 235th week on the SNX inflation schedule. This was determined through the same comumunity governance process.
