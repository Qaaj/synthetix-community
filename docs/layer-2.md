In order to effectively compete with centralized alternatives, Synthetix intends to migrate the system onto a scalable Layer 2 network. Despite recent improvements, gas costs on Mintr and Exchange are still quite high. Additionally, many potential traders and stakers aren't fluent enough in Web3 to participate in the network (without some abstraction). For both of these reasons, deploying Synthetix onto a scalable, user-friendly Layer 2 is a critical part of the roadmap. There have been early discussions around deploying on an Optimistic Rollup solution like the one used for the <a href="https://unipig.exchange/welcome" class="link" target="_blank">Unipig Demo</a> or integrating with <a href="https://skale.network/" class="link" target="_blank">Skale Network's L2 chain</a>.
